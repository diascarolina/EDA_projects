# Top Games on Google Play Store - An EDA


## Problem Context
A mobile game developer is planning to develop an Android game and put it on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps). The developer wants to strategically analyze the top existing games on Play Store in order to have a better sense of what to develop. The main questions that the developer wants an answer are:

- Which types of games are more successful in number of ratings?
- Paid or free games? If paid, what is a good price to go for?
- Which types of games are growing at the moment?
- Which types of games have the highest overall ratings?

We'll answer these questions using an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** approach using the "android-games.csv" dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) which can be found at [Top Games of Google Play Store](https://www.kaggle.com/dhruvildave/top-play-store-games).
